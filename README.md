# Exam_Insurance
This project explores whether a small, emotionally supportive insurance-like product can reduce that pressure. By offering a modest reward if students underperform relative to expectations, the goal is not financial protection but psychological reassurance. This web is use to take in information.

#Project: Student-Facing Risk Protection Concept

##1. Business Objective
The whole reason I want to create this exam-insurance idea is simply I’ve seen how stressed students are these days. Passing isn’t enough anymore — everyone feels pressure to score 80, 85, 90 just to feel “okay.” And that pressure builds up and hurts people more than we admit. 
I want this service to make students feel a little safer. Insurance, at its core, is meant to give people peace of mind when they’re worried about something uncertain, it is something that is supposed to be good and nice. Like why not bring that same comfort into school life? 
My goal is simple: if someone does well, great — that’s the best outcome. But if they don’t, at least they get something back. Something small but make them feel at least a bit better. I want this to take away just a bit of the fear around exams which may actually help them perform better. 

##2. Concept Overview
Students purchase a small “exam insurance” policy before the final exam.
If the student scores below a pre-defined threshold, they receive a small reward (AirPods, headphones, gift cards).
The purpose is behavioral and emotional, not financial gain.
Tagline / Slogan(maybe):
“A ray of sunshine for a cloudy future.”

##3. Target Market
Primary Customers: University students in a pilot class (30–50 students).
Secondary: Expand to multiple classes, courses, or universities.
Rationale: Students are future core insurance customers, but currently have little awareness or emotional experience of insurance.

##4. Risks & Considerations
Moral Hazard: Students might intentionally fail (mitigated by moderate prizes). 
Adverse Selection: Only anxious students may buy; people who purchase have higher risk.
Legal / Ethical: Not a regulated insurance product; framed as a behavioral prototype.
Reputational: Must clearly communicate the purpose is emotional support, not gambling or financial advice.


##5. Mechanics AND procedures to reduce the risks
Policy Purchase: Different premium based on the price of the reward. 
Examples:
Reward(Popular items among university students)
Premium(Adjust base on the actual cost of reward)
Airpods
45$
Hoodie
25$
Speakers
50$


#Threshold Design:
Students will be required to provide prior performance (quizzes, midterms, assignments).
Based on these results, We will put students into 4 different thresholds: 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%. 
For example, if the current average is between 45% to 54%, then the student will be eligible to apply for the 50% threshold, which means if the student ends up with a final grade less than 50%, then reward will be provided. The students will always be able to apply for the threshold that is below their current average: 
55% to 64% -> eligible for 60%, 50%
65% to 74% -> eligible for 70%, 60%, 50%
75% to 84% -> eligible for 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%
The reward won’t vary by the thresholds but only the premium price.

Application:
Students can fill their personal information on this demo website:	https://examinsurance.netlify.app/
Student ID and school email will be required.
A video of students logging into their account using the email that they provided and showing their current average will also be required. The approval part can be replaced by AI(Extract data from video) when the size grows.
After the final comes out, an email will be sent that requires students to upload their final official transcript to certify and a reward will be sent based on the result.

Example (simplified math):
Expected payout = P × V + loading


Assume 20% of students fall below threshold, V = $200(Airpods), loading = $5 (Advertising purpose)


Premium = 0.2 × 200 + 5 = $45 (conceptual expected loss for insurer)
##6. Technical / Intellectual Rigor
Probability & Expected Value: Calculate risk-adjusted payouts.


Behavioral Incentives: Reduce moral hazard (moderate prizes, not enough to encourage intentional failure, Students in Waterloo cares a lot about grades).


Risk Pooling & Adverse Selection: Tiered thresholds based on prior performance to reduce asymmetric information.


Statistical Analysis: Future surveys could refine probabilities of success based on midterm/quizzes.


Future Advanced Modeling (AI or stats models) :


Logistic regression to predict probability of failing given prior scores


Monte Carlo simulations for expected payout distributions


Sensitivity analysis for premium pricing


Incorporate elements from actuarial science: risk margins, premium loadings, expected vs. worst-case scenarios
##7. Operational Plan
Start small (Only cs, maths, or engineering majors).
Collect data via simple web or app or even Google form.
Put posters around school and use social media accounts to advertise.
Track emotional impact: optional surveys to measure stress reduction and satisfaction.
##8. Emotional / Human Design Principle
Students are under high stress; this project is designed to soften the emotional load, not replace hard work.
Provides an early emotional experience with insurance — planting a positive association with the concept of protection and support.
Inspired by the luxury car story: positive first experiences create long-term loyalty and trust.
